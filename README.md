# ow2autokey
automatically opens twitch to watch karq stream for overwatch2 key (if he stops streaming will change to other big streamers)
will only open the stream when:
- it is past 3am aest on the 28th
- karq is currently streaming


## **note**
make sure you are autologged into twitch on ur default system browser as this is the browser **ow2autokey** will use

this can be tested by running **browsertest.exe** which should open https://twitch.tv/KarQ when executed
